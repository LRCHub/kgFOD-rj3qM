I don't know
what you've been told
But I'd be insane not
to play my role
Yeah, I know I can break or fold
The stakes are low
If I could say one thing
Just know that
I gotta hand that I can lend ya
And it don't matter when,
know I'll protect ya
You can call on me
I'm here whenever
You know two greater than one
but five is better
Just know that
I gotta hand that I can lend ya
And it don't matter when,
know I'll protect ya
You can call on me
I'm here whenever
You know two greater than one
but five is better
Hey
Oh you think you tough, huh?
I think that's unlikely
You can keep on lookin' but
can't find nobody like me
El Dorado pushin'
Boy, I'm fresher
than a white tee
You know I love you
I need someone who can guide me
I can't do no lil bag (cash out)
I need three mil
Shots comin' in,
both directions
just like a BeReal
I been eating good
Used to be lucky
to get three meals
First place, run it up
Could care about what he feel
Cause I have you, you, you
(Give you everything and
anything you want)
Cause I have you, you, you
(You're my everything and
anything beyond)
Just know that
I gotta hand that I can lend ya
And it don't matter when,
know I'll protect ya
You can call on me
I'm here whenever
You know two greater than
one but five is better
Just know that
I gotta hand that
I can lend ya
And it don't matter when,
know I'll protect ya
You can call on me
I'm here whenever
You know two greater than
one but five is better
Hey
Two, One
Two, One
